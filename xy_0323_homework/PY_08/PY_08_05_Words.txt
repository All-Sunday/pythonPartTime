3.We, based on the theme of "Learning Revolution and Higher Education Transformation", exchanged our experiences in MOOC development, online education amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the comprehensive integration of ICT and higher education in various countries. Moreover, we conducted discussions, which have advanced the formation of a consensus on the development of MOOC and online education in higher education, have further promoted international exchanges and cooperation in "Internet Plus" and "Smart Plus" education, and have led to an important foundation for jointly promoting the progress towards SDG 4.
