The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be

is 
largely because, 
Lanimals, we stand upright. This means that our noses are _3_ to perceiving those

Our noses are capable of_]_ human smells even when these are--8_ to far below one part 
in one million. 
Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not 

another,_9_ others are sensitive

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill 
us but the doubters insisted that we didn't know for sure? That the evidence was 
inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy 
our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans 
bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early 
graves. 
There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to 
awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the 
National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth's 
atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The 
clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the 
National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel's 
report: "Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best 
available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base 
important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the 
future consequences of present actions." 
Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the 
science about global warming is incomplete, that it's OK to keep pouring fumes into 
the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of 
the evidence is in, it may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent 
people would take out an insurance policy now. 
Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it's obvious that a 
majority of the president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously. Instead 
of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research - a classic case of 
"paralysis by analysis". 
To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper 
atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the 
Administration won't take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin 
fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West 
Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising 
start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to 
meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial 
that those new plants be environmentally sound. 

26. An argument made by supporters of smoking was that 

[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death. 

[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant. 

[C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life. 

[D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense. 

27. According to Bruce Alberts, science can serve as 

[A] a protector. 

[B] a judge. 

[C] a critic. 

[D] a guide. 

28. What does the author mean by "paralysis by analysis" (Last line, Paragraph 4 ) ? 

[A] Endless studies kill action. 

[B] Careful investigation reveals truth. 

[C] Prudent planning hinders progress. 

[D] Extensive research helps decision-making. 

29. According to the author, what should the Administration do about global warming? 

[A] Off er aid to build cleaner power plants. 

[B] Raise public awareness of conservation. 

[C] Press for further scientific research. 

[D] Take some legislative measures. 

30. The author associates the issue of global warming with that of smoking because 

[A] they both suffered from the government' s negligence. 

[B] a lesson from the latter is applicable to the former. 

[C] the outcome of the latter aggravates the former. 

[D] both of them have turned from bad to worse. 

Text3 

Of all the components of a good night's sleep, dreams seem to be least within our 
control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead 
people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams 
were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, 
neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just "mental noise" - the random 
byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers 
suspect that dreams are part of the mind's emotional thermostat, regulating moods 
while the brain is "off-line." And one leading authority says that these intensely 
powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under 
conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better. "It's your dream," says Rosalind 
Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago's Medical Center. "If you don't like it, 
change it. " 
Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during 
REM (rapid eye movement) sleep - when most vivid dreams occur - as it is when 
fully awake, says Dr. Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts 
of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the "emotional brain") is 
especially active, while the prefrontal cortex ( the center of intellect and reasoning) is 
relatively quiet. "We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings 
can stay with us all day." says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement. 
The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in 
Cartwright's clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, 
progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working 
through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is 
occupied with daily life we don't always think about the emotional significance of the 
day's events - until, it appears, we begin to dream. 
And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can 
exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, 
identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end 
instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With 
much practice people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep. 
At the end of the day, there's probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams 
at all unless they keep us from sleeping or "we wake up in a panic," Cartwright says. 
Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased 
people's anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a 
therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. 
Sleep- or rather dream - on it and you'll feel better in the morning. 

31. Researchers have come to believe that dreams 
[A] can be modified in their courses. 
[B] are susceptible to emotional changes. 
[C] reflect our innermost desires and fears. 
[D] are a random outcome of neural repairs. 

32. By referring to the limbic system, the author intends to show 
[A] its function in our dreams. 
[B] the mechanism of REM sleep. 
[C] the relation of dreams to emotions. 
[D] its difference from the prefrontal cortex. 

33. The negative feelings generated during the day tend to 
[A] aggravate in our unconscious mind. 
[B] develop into happy dreams. 
[C] persist till the time we fall asleep. 
[D] show up in dreams early at night. 

34. Cartwright seems to suggest that 
[A] waking up in time is essential to the ridding of bad dreams. 
[B] visualizing bad dreams helps bring them under control. 
[C] dreams should be left to their natural progression. 
[D] dreaming may not entirely belong to the unconscious. 

3 5. What advice might Cartwright give to those who sometimes have bad dreams? 
[A] Lead your life as usual. 
[B] Seek professional help. 
[C] Exercise conscious control. 
[D] A void anxiety in the daytime. 

Text4 

Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to 

command the English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such 

command themselves. In his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of 

Language and Music and Why We Should Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and 

controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s 

counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English. 

Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism 

against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter' s academic speciality is language 

history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of "whom", for example, 

to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English. 

But the cult of the authentic and the personal, "doing our own thing", has spelt 

the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly 

educated sought an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even 

the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the 

page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that 

could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing 

over speaking, spontaneity over craft. 

Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, 

the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take 

the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges 

that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, 

can be powerfully expressive - there exists no language or dialect in the world that 

cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer 

think straight because we do not talk proper. 

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of 

memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech 

that would seem old-fashioned 

to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter 

acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical 

education reforms - he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more 

than useful. We now take our English "on paper plates instead of china". A shame, 

perhaps, but probably an inevitable one. 

36. According to Mc Whorter, the decline of formal English 
[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms. 
[B] is but all too natural in language development. 
[C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture. 
[D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s. 

37. The word "talking" (Line 6, Paragraph 3) denotes 
[A] modesty. 
[B] personality. 
[C] liveliness. 
[D] informality. 

3 8. To which of the following statements would Mc Whorter most likely agree? 
[A] Logical thinking is not necessarily related to the way we talk. 
[B] Black English can be more expressive than standard English. 
[C] Non-standard varieties of human language are just as entertaining. 
[D] Of all the varieties, standard English can best convey complex ideas. 

3 9. The description of Russians' love of memorizing poetry shows the author's 
[A] interest in their language. 
[B] appreciation of their efforts. 
[C] admiration for their memory. 
[D] contempt for their old-fashionedness. 

40. According to the last paragraph, "paper plates" is to "china" as 
[A] "temporary" is to "permanent". 
[B] "radical" is to "conservative". 
[C] "functional" is to "artistic". 
[D] "humble" is to "noble".

Canada's premiers ( the leaders of provincial governments), if they have any 
breath left after complaining about Ottawa at their late July annual meeting, might 
spare a moment to do something, together, to reduce health-care costs. 
They're all groaning about soaring health budgets, 
the fastest-growing 
component of which are pharmaceutical costs. 
(41) ______ _ 
What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health 
care - to say nothing of reports from other experts - recommended the creation of a 
national drug agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, 
bureaucracy, procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, 
work with Ottawa, and create a national institution. 
(42) ______ _ 
But "national" doesn't have 
to mean 
that. "National" could mean 
interprovincial - provinces combining efforts to create one body. 
Either way, one benefit of a "national" organization would be to negotiate better 
prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead of having one province - or a 
series of hospitals within a province - negotiate a price for a given drug on the 
provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces. 
Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the 
national agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics 
suggests the greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood of a better price. 
(43) ______ _ 
A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation 
of the Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by 
Ottawa and the provinces. Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to 
provincial lists which new drugs should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, 
Quebec refused to join. 
A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. They 
(particularly Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over additional billions 
with few, if any, strings attached. That's one reason why the idea of a national list 
hasn't gone anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast. 

(44) ______ _ 
Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow's report selectively, especially the parts 
about more federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had to say about drugs: 
"A national drug agency would provide governments more 
influence on 
pharmaceutical companies in order to try to constrain the ever-increasing cost of 
drugs." 
(45) ______ _ 
So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual complaint 
list, they should also get cracking about something in their jurisdiction that would 
help their budgets and patients. 

[A] Quebec's resistance to a national agency is provincialist ideology. One of the first 
advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec's Drug 
Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases from 14. 3 per 
cent to 26. 8 per cent! 

[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby's report: "The substantial buying power of 
such an agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to 
negotiate the lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies." 

[C] What does "national" mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby 
recommended a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National 
Health Council. 

[D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, are, and will 
continue to increase faster than government revenues. 

[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug 
costs have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part 
of the increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. 
Part of it arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher 
pnces. 

[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can 
run it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save 
administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, 
and bargain for better drug prices. 

[G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; 
they can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from 
one province to another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on 
its list, the pressure will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn't like a 
national agency, but self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this overwhelmingly 
significant phase in European history. History and news become confused, and one's 
impressions tend to be a mixture of skepticism and optimism. ( 46) Television is one 
of the means by which these feelings are created and conveyed - and perhaps never 
before has it served so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent 
events in Europe. The Europe that is now forming cannot be anything other than its 
peoples, their cultures and national identities. With this in mind we can begin to 
analyze the European television scene. (47) In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media 
groups have been increasingly successful; groups which bring together television, 
radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses that work in relation to one 
another. One Italian example would be the Berlusconi group, while abroad Maxwell 
and Murdoch come to mind. 
Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are going to be 
able to compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. ( 48) This alone 
demonstrates that the television business is not an easy world to survive in, a fact 
underlined by statistics that show that out of eighty European television networks, no 
less than 50% took a loss in 1989. 
Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige television 
companies to cooperate more closely in terms of both production and distribution. 
( 49) Creating a "European identity" that respects the different cultures and 
traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy 
task and demands a strategic choice - that of producing programs in Europe for 
Europe. This entails reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose 
programs relate to experiences and cultural traditions which are different from our own. 
In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on co-productions, 
the exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the 
agreements between European countries for the creation of a European bank for 
Television Production which, on the model of the European Investments Bank, will 
handle the finances necessary for production costs. (50) In dealing with a challenge 
on such a scale, it is no exaggeration to say, "United we stand, divided we 
fall" - and if I had to choose a slogan it would be "Unity in our diversity. " A unity of 
objectives that nonetheless respect the varied peculiarities of each country.

Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry 
William 
Shakespeare - but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. 
There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions 
of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the 
townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look 
at Anne Hathaway's Cottage, Shakespeare's birthplace and the other sights. 
The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theater adds a penny to their 
revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC's actors, them with their long hair and beards 
and sandals and noisiness. It's all deliciously ironic when you consider that 
Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his 
share of noise-making. 
The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by 
bus - and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side - don't 
usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in 
Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their 
playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town's 
revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash 
into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of 
town by nightfall. 
The townsfolk don't see it this way and the local council does not contribute 
directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. 
Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. 
Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with 
Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, 
and will be very expensive. 
Anyway, the townsfolk can't understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company 
needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. 
Last year its 1,4 31 seats were 94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they'll 
do better.) The reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have 
stayed low. 
It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the 
young people who are Stratford's most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the 
plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all 
over) - lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns 
and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 
seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the 
box office opens at 10: 3 0 a.m. 

26. From the first two paragraphs, we learn that 
[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC's contribution to the town's revenue. 
[B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage. 
[C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms. 
[D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism. 

27. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that 
[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately. 
[B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers. 
[C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers. 
[D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater. 

28. By saying "Stratford cries poor traditionally" (Line 2, Paragraph 4), the author 
implies that 
[A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects. 
[B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties. 
[C] the town is not really short of money. 
[D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid. 

29. According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because 
[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending. 
[B] the company is financially ill-managed. 
[C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable. 
[D] the theatre attendance is on the rise. 

30. From the text we can conclude that the author 
[A] is supportive of both sides. 
[B] favors the townsfolk's view. 
[C] takes a detached attitude. 
[D] is sympathetic to the RSC.

[A] large animals were vulnerable to the changing environment. 
[B] small species survived as large animals disappeared. 
[C] large sea animals may face the same threat today. 
[D] slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones. 

3 2. We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm's paper that 
[A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%. 
[B] there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago. 
[C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount. 
[D] the number of large predators dropped faster in new fisheries than in the old. 

3 3 . By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, Paragraph 3 ) , Dr. Worm 
means that 
[A] fishing technology has improved rapidly. 
[B] the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded. 
[C] the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss. 
[D] the data collected so far are out of date. 

3 4. Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that 
[A] people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time. 
[B] fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass. 
[C] the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level. 
[D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing situation. 

3 5. The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries' 
[A] management efficiency. 
[B] biomass level. 
[C] catch-size limits. 
[D] technological application. 

Text 4 

Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest may be this: 
artists' only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that 
feel bad. 
This wasn't always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are 
those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century onward, 
more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring, as 
we went from Wordsworth's daffodils to Baudelaire' s flowers of evil. 
You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modem 
times have seen so much misery. But it's not as if earlier times didn't know perpetual 
war, disaster and the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the 
opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the world today. 
After all, what is the one modem form of expression almost completely 
dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost 
exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in 
which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology. 
People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked 
until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass 
communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which 
reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be 
meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too. 
Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious 
but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, 
all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy 
families in perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda - to lure us to 
open our wallets - they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable."Celebrate!" 
commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could 
increase the risk of heart attacks. 
But what we forget - what our economy depends on us forgetting - is that 
happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy 
carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by 
promises of easy happiness, we need art to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: 
remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in 
denying this but in living with it. It's a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, 
yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air. 

3 6. By citing the examples of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends 
to show that 
[A] poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music. 
[B] art grows out of both positive and negative feelings. 
[C] poets today are less skeptical of happiness. 
[D] artists have changed their focus of interest. 

37. The word "bummer" (Line 5, Paragraph 5) most probably means something 
[A] religious. 
[B] unpleasant. 
[C] entertaining. 
[D] commercial. 

3 8 . In the author's opinion, advertising 
[A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art. 
[B] is a cause of disappointment for the general public. 
[C] replaces the church as a major source of information. 
[D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself. 

3 9. We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes 
[A] happiness more often than not ends in sadness. 
[B] the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing. 
[C] misery should be enjoyed rather than denied. 
[D] the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms. 

40. Which of the following is true of the text? 
[A] Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery. 
[B] Art provides a balance between expectation and reality. 
[C] People feel disappointed at the realities of modem society. 
[D] Mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of David 
Williams, 52, and of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling games are played). 
During several years of gambling in that casino, Williams, a state auditor earning 
$3 5,000 a year, lost approximately $175,000. He had never gambled before the casino 
sent him a coupon for $20 worth of gambling. 
He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he lost $800. The 
casino issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card," which when used in the 
casino earns points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to track the user's 
gambling activities. For Williams, those activities became what he calls "electronic 
heroin." 
(41 ) _____________ In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot 
machine in two days. In March 1997 he lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot 
machines at a time, all night, until the boat docked at 5 a.m., then went back aboard 
when the casino opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing the casino, charging that it should 
have refused his patronage because it knew he was addicted. It did know he had a 
problem. 
In March 1998, a friend of Williams's got him involuntarily confined to a 
treatment center for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams's 
gambling problem. The casino included a photo of Williams among those of banned 
gamblers, and wrote 
to him a "cease admissions" 
letter. Noting 
the 
"medical/psychological" nature of problem gambling behavior, the letter said that 
before being readmitted to the casino he would have to present medical/psychological 
information demonstrating that patronizing the casino would pose no threat to his 
safety or well-being. 
(42) _________ _ 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 24 signs warning: "Enjoy the 
fun ... and always bet with your head, not over it." Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free 
number for counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health. Nevertheless, 
Williams's suit charges that the casino, knowing he was "helplessly addicted to 
gambling," intentionally worked to "lure" him to "engage in conduct against his 
will." Well. 

[A] Although no such evidence was presented, the casino's marketing department 
continued to pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino and used 
his Fun Card without being detected. 

[B] It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior. 
And in what sense was his will operative? 

[C] By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he could get back to even, 
he would quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit. 

[D] Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a long 
time it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a social policy: 
the most important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the 
government. 

[E] David Williams's suit should trouble this gambling nation. But don't bet on it. 

[F] It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral problems, 
often defin ing as add ic t ion s what ear l ier , s te rne r gene ra t ion s exp la ined as 
weakness of will. 

[G] The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of online gambling is especially 
conducive to compulsive behavior. But even if the government knew how to move 
against Internet gambling, what would be its grounds for doing so?

Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no account 
in his society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father Bruckberger told part of 
the story when he observed that it is the intellectuals who have rejected America. But 
they have done more than that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of the 
intellectual. It is they, not America, who have become anti-intellectual. 
First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an intellectual? ( 46) _I 
shall define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and 
pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a Socratic( in, ,Mr m [ij;) way about moral 
problems. He explores such problems consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by 
asking factual questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action 
which seems appropriate in the light of the factual and moral information which he 
has obtained.(47) His function is analogous to that of a judge, who must accept the 
obligation of revealing in as obvious a manner as possible the course of reasoning 
which led him to his decision. 
This definition 
excludes many 
individuals usually 
referred 
to 
as 
intellectuals - the average scientist, for one. ( 48) I have excluded him because, while 
his accomplishments may contribute to the solution of moral problems, he has not 
been charged with the task of approaching any but the factual aspects of those 
problems. Like other human beings, he encounters moral issues even in the everyday 
performance of his routine duties - he is not supposed to cook his experiments, 
manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. ( 49) But his primary task is not to think 
about the moral code which governs his activity, any more than a businessman is 
expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration of rules of conduct in business. 
During most of his waking life he will take his code for granted, as the businessman 
takes his ethics. 
The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact that 
teaching has traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn their 
living. (50) They may teach very well, and more than earn their salaries, but most of 
them make little or no independent reflections on human problems which involve 
moral judgment. This description even fits the majority of eminent scholars. Being 
learned in some branch of human knowledge is one thing ; 
living in "public and 
illustrious thoughts," as Emerson would say, is something else.

The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often egalitarian, valuing 
equality of everything. Bolivar had received aid from Haiti and had 16

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s
World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer
players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the
later months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the
World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be
even more pronounced.
What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a)
certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to
have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents
are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania;
d) none of the above.
Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University,
says he believes strongly in “none of the above.” Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and
studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to
conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly
30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random
series of numbers. “With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit
span had risen from 7 to 20,” Ericsson recalls. “He kept improving, and after about
200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.”
This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not
genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more
of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn
differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences
are swamped by how well each person “encodes” the information. And the best way
to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process
known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a
task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and
concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a
wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just
performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own
laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling
assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way,
exper t performers C whether
in memory or
surgery, ballet or compu ter
programmingC are nearly always made, not born.

21. The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to
[A] stress the importance of professional training.
[B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.
[C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.
[D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others.

22. The word “mania” (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means
[A] fun.
[B] craze.
[C] hysteria.
[D] excitement.

23. According to Ericsson, good memory
[A] depends on meaningful processing of information.
[B] results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises.
[C] is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors.
[D] requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration.

24. Ericsson and his colleagues believe that
[A] talent is a dominating factor for professional success.
[B] biographical data provide the key to excellent performance.
[C] the role of talent tends to be overlooked.
[D] high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture.

25. Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to convey?
[A] “Faith will move mountains.”
[B] “One reaps what one sows.”
[C] “Practice makes perfect.”
[D] “Like father, like son.”

Text 2

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured
a column called “Ask Marilyn.” People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who
at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an
IQ of 228 C the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and
visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce
numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos
Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the
difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence?
It’ s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical
patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and
philosophers.
Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it
mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we
learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?
The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even
though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in
two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales
(both come in adult and children’ s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars,
they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate
bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’ s are no longer
possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among
age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and
multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test
(SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.
Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to
succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How
Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess
analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge,
components also critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not
necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found
that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress
conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with
leadership C that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will
testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it's knowing when to guess or what
questions to skip.

26. Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?
[A] Answering philosophical questions.
[B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.
[C] Telling the differences between certain concepts.
[D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.

27. What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?
[A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.
[B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.
[C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.
[D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.

28. People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant’ s because
[A] the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.
[B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.
[C] vos Savant’ s case is an extreme one that will not repeat.
[D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.

29. We can conclude from the last paragraph that
[A] test scores may not be reliable indicators of one’ s ability.
[B] IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated.
[C] testing involves a lot of guesswork.
[D] traditional tests are out of date.

30. What is the author’ s attitude towards IQ tests?
[A] Supportive.
[B] Skeptical.
[C] Impartial.
[D] Biased.

Text 3

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could
count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been
transformed by economic risk and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or
a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in
a few months.
In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming
basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have
debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect:
family risk has risen as well. Today’ s families have budgeted to the limits of their
new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in
times of financial setback C a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the
workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This “added-worker effect”
could support
the safety net offered by unemployment
insurance or disability
insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family
fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home
partner.
During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in
their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto
industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock
market fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money.
For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a
savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments
for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is
not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by
families have risen C and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from
legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new
dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are
working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly
parentC and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance C have jumped
eightfold in just one generation.
From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks
far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal
more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their
already overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political
fallout may not be far behind.

31. Today’ s double-income families are at greater financial risk in that
[A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.
[B] their chances of being laid off have greatly increased.
[C] they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics.
[D] they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance.

32. As a result of President Bush’ s reform, retired people may have
[A] a higher sense of security.
[B] less secured payments.
[C] less chance to invest.
[D] a guaranteed future.

33. According to the author, health-savings plans will
[A] help reduce the cost of healthcare.
[B] popularize among the middle class.
[C] compensate for the reduced pensions.
[D] increase the families’ investment risk.

34. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
[A] financial risks tend to outweigh political risks.
[B] the middle class may face greater political challenges.
[C] financial problems may bring about political problems.
[D] financial responsibility is an indicator of political status.

35. Which of the following is the best title for this text?
[A] The Middle Class on the Alert
[B] The Middle Class on the Cliff
[C] The Middle Class in Conflict
[D] The Middle Class in Ruins

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their
worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation
governance, a new problem threatens to earn them C especially in America C the
sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data
insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a
concern only of data-rich industries such as banking,
telecoms and air travel,
information protection is now high on the boss’ s agenda in businesses of every
variety.
Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year C from
organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science
Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley C
have left managers hurriedly peering into their intricate IT systems and business
processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.
“Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other
asset,” says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’ s business school. “The ability
to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for
on behalf of shareholders”. Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted
Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’ s Columbia Business School.
“Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a
management issue, not a technical one,” he says.
The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should
be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets,
is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore C and that few things are more
likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the
wrong hands.
The current state of affairs may have been encouraged C though not justified C
by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until
California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the
victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security
legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of
information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June
17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’ s Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will
act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.

36. The statement “It never rains but it pours” is used to introduce
[A] the fierce business competition.
[B] the feeble boss-board relations.
[C] the threat from news reports.
[D] the severity of data leakage.

37. According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out
[A] whether there is any weak point.
[B] what sort of data has been stolen.
[C] who is responsible for the leakage.
[D] how the potential spies can be located.

38. In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that
[A] shareholders’ interests should be properly attended to.
[B] information protection should be given due attention.
[C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.
[D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.

39. According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to
[A] see the link between trust and data protection.
[B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data.
[C] realize the high cost of data restoration.
[D] appreciate the economic value of trust.

40. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that
[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe.
[B] FTC’s decision is essential to data security.
[C] California takes the lead in security legislation.
[D] legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

How Can a Parent Help?

Mothers and fathers can do a lot to ensure a safe landing in early adulthood for
their kids. Even if a job’s starting salary seems too small to satisfy an emerging
adult’s need for rapid content, the transition from school to work can be less of a
setback if the start-up adult is ready for the move. Here are a few measures, drawn
from my book Ready or Not, Here Life Comes, that parents can take to prevent what I
call “work-life unreadiness”:

41
You can start this process when they are 11 or 12. Periodically review their
emerging strengths and weaknesses with them and work together on any shortcomings,
like difficulty in communicating well or collaborating. Also, identify the kinds of
interests they keep coming back to, as these offer clues to the careers that will fit them
best.

42
Kids need a range of authentic role models C as opposed to members of their
clique, pop stars and vaunted athletes. Have regular dinner-table discussions about
people the family knows and how they got where they are. Discuss the joys and
downsides of your own career and encourage your kids to form some ideas about
their own future. When asked what they want to do, they should be discouraged from
saying “I have no idea.” They can change their minds 200 times, but having only a
foggy view of the future is of little good.

43

Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should be
responsible for teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities around the house
and make sure homework deadlines are met. Encourage teenagers to take a part-time
job. Kids need plenty of practice delaying gratification and deploying effective
organizational skills, such as managing time and setting priorities.

44
Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of watching TV
shows with canned laughter only teaches kids to process information in a passive way.
At the same time, listening through earphones to the same monotonous beats for long
stretches encourages kids to stay inside their bubble instead of pursuing other
endeavors. All these activities can prevent the growth of important communication
and thinking skills and make it difficult for kids to develop the kind of sustained
concentration they will need for most jobs.

45
They should know how to deal with setbacks, stresses and feelings of inadequacy.
They should also learn how to solve problems and resolve conflicts, ways to
brainstorm and think critically. Discussions at home can help kids practice doing
these things and help them apply these skills to everyday life situations.
What about the son or daughter who is grown but seems to be struggling and
wandering aimlessly through early adulthood? Parents still have a major role to play,
but now it
is more delicate. They have to be careful not
to come across as
disappointed in their child. They should exhibit strong interest and respect for
whatever currently interests their fledging adult (as naive or ill conceived as it may
seem) while becoming a partner in exploring options for the future. Most of all, these
new adults must feel
that
they are respected and supported by a family that
appreciates them.

The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic intellectual
discipline in European universities. However, only in recent years has it become a
feature of undergraduate programs in Canadian universities. (46) Traditionally, legal
learning has been viewed in such institutions as the special preserve of lawyers, rather
than a necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated person. Happily, the
older and more continental view of legal education is establishing itself in a number
of Canadian universities and some have even begun to offer undergraduate degrees in
law.

If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and parcel of a general
education, its aims and methods should appeal directly to journalism educators. Law
is a discipline which encourages responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides
opportunities to analyze such ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. (47) On the
other, it links these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to the
links journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment on the news. For
example, notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights and public interest are at work
in the process of journalistic judgment and production just as in courts of law.
Sharpening judgment by absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of
a journalist’s intellectual preparation for his or her career.
(48) But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more profoundly
than an ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the established conventions and
special responsibilities of the news media. Politics or, more broadly, the functioning
of the state, is a major subject for journalists. The better informed they are about the
way the state works, the better their reporting will be. (49) In fact, it is difficult to see
how journalists who do not have a clear grasp of the basic features of the Canadian
Constitution can do a competent job on political stories.
Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are primary
subjects for journalists. While the quality of legal journalism varies greatly, there is an
undue reliance amongst many journalists on interpretations supplied to them by
lawyers. (50) While comment and reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it is
preferable for journalists to rely on their own notions of significance and make their
own judgments. These can only come from a well-grounded understanding of the
legal system.

The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of 
those hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is 1

is that 
2 
bird, a scientist who works independently 3

institution. He helped popularize the idea that some diseases not 4 
thought to have 
a bacterial cause were actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was 
first suggested. 
5 he, however, might tremble at the 6 
of what he is about to do. Together 
with another two scientists, he is publishing a paper which not only 
7 
that one

While still catching up to men in some spheres of modem life, women appear to 
be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. "Women are particularly 
susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress 
compared to men," according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York's 
Veteran's Administration Hospital. 
Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow 
affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger 
chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when 
stressed-out female rats had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, 
their chemical responses became equal to those of the males. 
Adding to a woman's increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased 
"opportunities" for stress. "It's not necessarily that women don't cope as well. It's 
just that they have so much more to cope with," says Dr. Y ehuda. "Their capacity for 
tolerating stress may even be greater than men's," she observes, "it's just that they're 
dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and 
sooner." 
Dr. Y ehuda notes another difference between the sexes. "I think that the kinds of 
things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. 
Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of 
random physical violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are 
exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other 
family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear 
that 
comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating." 
Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to 
finish college. "I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much 
frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better." Later, 
her marriage ended and she became a single mother. "It's the hardest thing to take care 
of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. I lived 
from paycheck to paycheck." 
Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. 
But most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and 
feeling the strain. Alvarez's experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways 
to diffuse stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function. 

2 1. Which of the following is true according to the first two paragraphs? 
[A] Women are biologically more vulnerable to stress. 
[B] Women are still suffering much stress caused by men. 
[C] Women are more experienced than men in coping with stress. 
[D] Men and women show different inclinations when faced with stress. 

22. Dr. Yehuda's research suggests that women 
[A] need extra doses of chemicals to handle stress. 
[B] have limited capacity for tolerating stress. 
[C] are more capable of avoiding stress. 
[D] are exposed to more stress. 

23. According to Paragraph 4, the stress women confront tends to be 
[A] domestic and temporary. 
[B] irregular and violent. 
[C] durable and frequent. 
[D] trivial and random. 

24. The sentence "I lived from paycheck to paycheck." (Line 6, Para.5) shows that 
[A] Alvarez cared about nothing but making money. 
[B] Alvarez's salary barely covered her household expenses. 
[C] Alvarez got paychecks from different jobs. 
[D] Alvarez paid practically everything by check.

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the 
laboratory would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor 
would then remove the authors' names and affiliations from the paper and send it to 
their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept 
the paper for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, 
and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the 
journal. 
No longer. The Internet ― and pressure from funding agencies, who are 
questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded 
research by restricting access to it―is making free access to scientific results a reality. 
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just 
issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John 
Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, 
makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made handsome profits. But it 
goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element 
of scientific endeavour. 
The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research 
depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In 
America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and 
$11 billion. The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical 
Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in 
these subjects. They publish more than 1. 2 million articles each year in some 16,000 
journals. 
This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 7 5% of scholarly 
journals are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging ; three main ones 
were identified by the report's authors. There is the so-called big deal, where 
institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through 
site-licensing agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by 
asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there 
are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international 
laboratories support institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of 
these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to 
read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone 
who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review 
process, at least for the publication of papers. 

26. In the first paragraph, the author discusses 
[A] the background information of j oumal editing. 
[B] the publication routine of laboratory reports. 
[C] the relations of authors with journal publishers. 
[D] the traditional process of journal publication. 

27. Which of the following is true of the OECD report? 
[A] It criticizes government-funded research. 
[B] It introduces an effective means of publication. 
[C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers. 
[D] It benefits scientific research considerably. 

28. According to the text, online publication is significant in that 
[A] it provides an easier access to scientific results. 
[B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers. 
[C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge. 
[D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research. 

29. With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is required to 
[A] cover the cost of its publication. 
[B] subscribe to the journal publishing it. 
[C] allow other online journals to use it freely. 
[D] complete the peer-review before submission. 

30. Which of the following best summarizes the text? 
[A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers. 
[B] A new mode of publication is emerging. 
[C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication. 
[D] Publication is rendered easier by online service.

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of the only three players in the 
National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last 
season, however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major 
professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have 
been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, 
longer frames. 
The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: 
Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller 
now than 140 years ago, today's people ― especially those born to families who have 
lived in the U.S. for many generations ― apparently reached their limit in the early 
1960s. And they aren't likely to get any taller. "In the general population today, at 
this genetic, envirornnental level, we've pretty much gone as far as we can go, " says 
anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of 
NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common 
practice of recruiting players from all over the world. 
Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and 
nutrients ― notably, protein ― to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, 
under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health 
imp roved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an 
inch and a half every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height ― 5 '9" for 
men, 5 '4" for women ― hasn't really changed since 1960. 
Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During 
childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. 
Moreover, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and 
back continue to struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated 
strain imposed by oversize limbs. "There are some real constraints that are set by the 
genetic architecture of the individual organism," says anthropologist William Leonard

Genetic maximums can change, but don't expect this to happen soon. Claire C. 
Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures 
that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She

Text4 

In 1784 , five years before he became president of the United States, George 
Washington, 5 2, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transp lant nine teeth 
into his jaw ― having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves. 
That's a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopp ing George most peop le 
remember from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus 
on the role slavery p layed in the lives of the founding generation. They have been 
spurred in part by DNA evidence made available in 1998 , which almost certainly 
proved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. 
And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up . 
Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made by the nation's early 
leaders and the fragile nature of the country's infancy. More significantly, they argue 
that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong ― and yet most did little 
to fight it. 
More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the 
culture of their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for 
slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of 
the country they helped to create. 
For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves 
was "like having a large bank account," says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: 
George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states 
would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the "peculiar 
institution," including a clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for 
purposes of congressional representation. 
And the statesmen's political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula 
handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating 
the votes of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson 
extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 ; the new land was carved into 
13 states, including three slave states. 
Still, Jefferson freed Hemings's children ― though not Hemings herself or his 
approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men 
were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the 
Revolutionary War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves 
their freedom in his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required 
legislative approval in Virginia. 

36. George Washington's dental surgery is mentioned to 

[A] show the primitive medical practice in the past. 
[B] demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days. 
[C] stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history. 
[D] reveal some unknown aspect of his life. 

3 7. We may infer from the second paragraph that 

[A] DNA technology has been widely applied to history research. 
[B] in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate situations. 
[C] historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson's life. 
[D] political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. history. 

38. What do we learn about Thomas Jefferson? 

[A] His political view changed his attitude towards slavery. 
[B] His status as a father made him free the child slaves. 
[C] His attitude towards slavery was complex. 
[D] His affair with a slave stained his prestige. 

39. Which of the following is true according to the text? 

[A] Some Founding Fathers benefit politically from slavery. 
[B] Slaves in the old days did not have the right to vote. 
[C] Slaves owners usually had large savings accounts. 
[D] Slavery was regarded as a peculiar institution. 

40. Washington's decision to free slaves originated from his 

[A] moral considerat10ns.

The time for sharpening pencils, arranging your desk, and doing almost anything 
else instead of writing has ended. The first draft will appear on the page only if you 
stop avoiding the inevitable and sit, stand up, or lie down to write. 
(41) 
Be flexible. Your outline should smoothly conduct you from one point to the next, 
but do not permit it to railroad you. If a relevant and important idea occurs to you now, 
work it into the draft. (42) 
Grammar, punctuat10n, 
and spelling can wait until you revise. Concentrate on what you are saying. Good 
w百ting most often occurs when you are in hot pursuit of an idea rather than in a 
nervous search for errors. 
(43) 
Your pages will be easier to keep track of that way, 
and, if you have to clip a paragraph to place it elsewhere, you will not lose any 
w百ting on the other side. 
If you are working on a word processor, you can take advantage of its capacity 
to make additions and deletions as well as move entire paragraphs by making just a 
few simple keyboard commands. Some software programs can also check spelling 
and certam grammatical elements m your wntmg. (44) 
These 
printouts are also easier to read than the screen when you work on revisions. 
Once you have a first draft on paper, you can delete material that is unrelated to 
your thesis and add material necessary to illustrate your points and make your paper 
convincing. The student who wrote "The A&P as a State of Mind" wisely dropped a 
paragraph that questioned whether Sammy displays chauvinistic attitudes toward 
women. (45 ) 
Remember that your initial draft is only that. You should go through the paper 
many times ― and then again ― working to substantiate and clarify your ideas. You 
may even end up with several entire versions of the paper. Rewrite. The sentences 
within each paragraph should be related to a single topic. Transitions should connect 
one paragraph to the next so that there are no abrupt or confusing shifts. Awkward or 
wordy phrasing or unclear sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and 
prodded into shape. 

[A] To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space between lines so 
that you can easily add words, sentences, and corrections. Write on only one 
side of the paper. 

[B] After you have clearly and adequately developed the body of your paper, pay 
p a r t icu la r a t ten t ion to the in t roduc to ry and conc lud ing p a rag rap h s . I t's 
probably best to w门te the introduction last, after you know precisely what you 
are introducing. Concluding paragraphs demand equal attention because they 
leave the reader with a final impression. 

[C] It's worth remembering, however, that though a clean copy fresh off a printer 
may look terrific, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that have 
gone into it. Many writers p rudently store their data on disks and print their 
pages each time they finish a draft to avoid losing any material because of 
power failures or other problems. 

[D] It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now that you have 
developed a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin 
to flesh out whatever outline you have made. 

[E] Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with the thesis, which 
exp lains how the setting influences Sammy's decision to quit his job. Instead 
of including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel's crabbed 
resp onse to the girls so that she could lead up to the A & P "po l icy " he 
enforces. 

[F] In the final paragraph about the significance of the setting 
in "A&P," 
the 
student brings together the reasons Sammy quit his job by referring to his refusal 
to accept Lengel's store policies. 

[G] By using the firs t draft as a means of thinking about what you want to say, you 
will very likely discover more than your notes originally suggested. Plenty of good 
writers don't use outlines at all but discover ordering princip les as they write. Do 
not attempt to compose a perfectly correct draft the first time around.

In his autobiography, Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual powers with 
extraordinary modesty. He points out that he always experienced much difficulty in 
expressing himself clearly and concisely, but (46) he believes that this very difficulty 
ma have had the com ensatin advanta e of forcin him to think lon and intentl 
about eve 
sentence and thus enablin him to detect errors in reasonin and in his 
own observations. He disclaimed the possession of any great quickness of 
apprehension or wit, such as distinguished Huxley. (47) He asserted also that his 
ower to follow a lon and urel abstract train of thou ht was ve 
limited for 
which reason he felt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics. 
His memory, too, he described as extensive, but ha勾.So poor in one sense was it that 
he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or a line of poetry. 
(48) On the other hand he did not acce t as well founded the char e made b some of 
his critics that while he was a ood observer he had no ower of reasonin . This, he 
thought, could not be true, because the "Origin of Species" is one long argument from 
the beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. No one, he submits, 
could have written it without possessing some power of reasoning. He was willing to 
assert that "I have a fair share of invention, and of common sense or judgment, such 
as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher 
degree." (49) He adds humbl 
that erha s he was "su erior to the common run of 
men in noticin 
thin s which easil 
esca e attention and in observin 
them 
carefully. " 
Writing i n the last year o f his life, h e expressed the opinion that i n two o r three 
respects his mind had changed during the preceding twenty or thirty years. Up to the 
age of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds gave him great pleasure. Formerly, too, 
pictures had given him considerable, and music very great, delight. In 18 81, however, 
he said: "Now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. I have also 
almost lost my taste for pictures or music." (50) Darwin was convinced that the loss 
of these tastes was not onl a loss of ha 
iness but mi ht ossibl be in・urious to the 
intellect, and more probably to the moral character.

Text 1 

Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on 

auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. "Not choice, 

but habit rules the unreflecting herd," William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In 
the ever-changing 21 st century, even the word "habit" carries a negative implication. 

So it seems paradoxical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and 

innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop 

new habits, we create parallel paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump 

our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks. 

Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habit, we can 

instead direct our own change by consciously developing new habits. In fact, the 

more new things we try - the more we step outside our comfort zone - the more 

inherently creative we become, both in the workplace and in our personal lives. 

But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are 

worn into the brain, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately press 

into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads. 

"The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder," says Dawna 
Markova, author of The Open Mind. "But we are taught instead to 'decide' , just as 

our president calls himself 'the Decider'. " She adds, however, that "to decide is to 

kill off all possibilities but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the 

many other possibilities. " 

All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she says. 

Researchers in the late 1960s discovered that humans are born with the capacity to 

approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally ( or 

collaboratively) and innovatively. At the end of adolescence, however, the brain shuts 

down half of that capacity, preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed 

most valuable during the first decade or so of life. 

The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, 

meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of 

thought. "This breaks the major rule in the American belief system - that anyone can 

do anything," explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book This Year I Will ... and Ms. 

Markova's business partner. "That's a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters 

commonness. Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates 

excellence. " This is where developing new habits comes in. 

21. In Wordsworth's view, "habits" is characterized by being 

[A] casual. 

[B] familiar. 

[C] mechanical. 

[D] changeable. 

22. Brain researchers have discovered that the formation of new habits can be 

[A] predicted. 

[B] regulated. 

[C] traced. 

[D] guided. 

23. The word "ruts" (Para. 4) is closest in meaning to 

[A] tracks. 

[B] series. 

[C] characteristics. 

[D] connections. 

24. Dawna Markova would most probably agree that 

[A] ideas are born of a relaxing mind. 

[B] innovativeness could be taught. 

[C] decisiveness derives from fantastic ideas. 

[D] curiosity activates creative minds. 

25. Ryan's comments suggest that the practice of standardized testing 

[A] prevents new habits from being formed. 

[B] no longer emphasizes commonness. 

[C] maintains the inherent American thinking mode. 

[D] complies with the American belief system. 

Text 2 

It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his 
paternal (fatherly) wisdom - or at least confirm that he's the kid's dad. All he needs to 
do is shell out $3 0 for a paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore - and another 
$120 to get the results. 
More than 60, 000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first became 
available without prescriptions last year, according to Doug Fogg, chief operating 
officer of Identigene, which makes the over-the-counter kits. More than two dozen 
companies sell DNA tests directly to the public, ranging in price from a few hundred 
dollars to more than $ 2 , 500. 
Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing, which adopted children 
can use to find their biological relatives and families can use to track down kids put 
up for adoption. DNA testing is also the latest rage among passionate genealogists -
and supports businesses that offer to search for a family's geographic roots. 
Most tests require collecting cells by swabbing saliva in the mouth and sending it 
to the company for testing. All tests require a potential candidate with whom to 
compare DNA. 
But some observers are skeptical. "There's a kind of false precision being 
hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing," says Troy Duster, a New 
York University sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors -
numbering in the hundreds just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only 
considers a single lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a 
father's line or mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down only from mothers. This 
DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even though, 
for example, just three generations back people also have six other great-grandparents 
or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-grandparents. 
Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference 
collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don't 
rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from 
different research projects. This means that a DNA database may have a lot of data 
from some regions and not others, so a person's test results may differ depending on 
the company that processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a 
company uses to estimate relationships may be patented and not subject to peer 
review or outside evaluation.

Text 4 

The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New World are the 
ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the 
standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "so 
much importance attached to intellectual pursuits." According to many books and 
articles, New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an 
unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life. 
To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the 
Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church -
important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of 
southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of 
European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances. The New England colonies 
were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of 
civility and virtuosity. 
The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education 
and influence in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to 
Massachusetts churches in the decade after 1629, there were political leaders like 
John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he 
journeyed to Boston. These men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New 
World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of 
intellectual earnestness. 
We should not forget, however, that most New Englanders were less well 
educated. While few craftsmen or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left 
literary compositions to be analyzed, it is obvious that their views were less fully 
intellectualized. Their thinking often had a traditional superstitious quality. A tailor 
named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 163 0s, left an account of his reasons for 
leaving England that is filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic frustrations, and 
religious hope - all came together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, 
told his father that the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical 
words: "Come out from among them, touch no unclean thing, and I will be your God 
and you shall be my people." One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons 
explaining the Bible that he heard in Puritan churches. 
Meanwhile, many settlers had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as 
one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had 
not come to the New World for religion. "Our main end was to catch fish." 

3 6 . The author holds that in the seventeenth-century New England 
[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life. 
[B] intellectual interests were encouraged. 
[C] politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors. 
[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment.

Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by 
British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 18 60s, British social philosopher Herbert 
Spencer put forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. Spencer 
argued that all worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, 
advancing toward perfection. ( 41) ________ _ 
American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of 
cultural evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan helped found modem anthropology - the 
scientific study of human societies, customs and beliefs - thus becoming one of the 
earliest anthropologists. In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture 
changed together in the evolution of societies. ( 42) ________ _ 
In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist 
Franz Boas developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism. 
Historical particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new 
direction to anthropology. (43 ) ________ _ 
Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a 
unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary 
stage or type of culture. ( 44) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in 
American anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. But 
a number of anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of 
culture in favor of diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural 
achievement to the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to 
diffusionists, then spread to other cultures. ( 4 5) ________ _ 
Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist Emile Durkheim developed a theory 
of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that 
religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest in the 
relationship between the function of society and culture became a major theme in 
European, and especially British, anthropology. 

[A] Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had 
a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as 
diffusionism. 

[B] In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, he became skilled 
in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of 
human biology and anatomy. 

[C] He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the 
"survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually 
be replaced by stronger, more advanced races and societies. 

[D] They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social 
structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance 
into adulthood. 

[E] Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, 
forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of 
government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as 
societies evolved. 

[F] Supporters of the theory viewed culture as a collection of integrated parts that 
work together to keep a society functioning. 

[G] For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry 
incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, 
pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused 
throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred 
separately at different times in many parts of the world.
